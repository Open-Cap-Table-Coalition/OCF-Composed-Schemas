## Notes / open questions

- Carta has no convertible transfer transaction. Therefore, this OCF event has no Carta destination for its `date`, `amount`, source `security_id`, `resulting_security_ids`, optional `balance_security_id`, or `consideration_text`; the OCF `id`, `comments`, and `object_type` are scaffolding and are not carried over.
- A cancellation followed by an issuance cannot represent this event without losing key causal information: it would replace one transfer event with two separate lifecycle events and fail to preserve the relationship between the source, resulting, and balance securities.
